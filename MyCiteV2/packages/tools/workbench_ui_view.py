"""Workbench-UI palette entry — the universal datum grid as a palette tool.

Workbench-UI is the universal SQL-backed datum grid that hosts the default
``/portal/system/tools/workbench-ui`` surface. Registering it here gives the
menubar palette an explicit "switch to the workbench grid" option whenever a
datum context selects a sandbox-source or system-anthology document — the
sibling of every dedicated viz tool (cts_gis, agro_erp, …).

The actual document_table / datum_grid / overlay rendering lives in
``MyCiteV2/instances/_shared/runtime/portal_workbench_ui_runtime.py`` and is
reached by navigating to ``WORKBENCH_UI_TOOL_ROUTE`` (carried on the palette
entry's ``route`` field by the shell, not by the build-payload contract).
This module exists solely so the viz registry — the one
``portal_palette_runtime.build_eligible_tools_response`` consults — can see
workbench_ui alongside cts_gis. See ``portal_tool_surface_contract.md``.
