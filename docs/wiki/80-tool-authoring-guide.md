# How to author a new workbench tool

## Goal

Teach you how to add a new **workbench tool** to the MyCite Portal: implement
the tool contract, register it so the portal can see it, declare which datums it
applies to, add the shell registry entry that lets it appear in the palette, and
then verify that it shows up in the menu-bar tool search and mounts into the
interface panel.

Tools (and lenses) exist to view and manage **hyphae** and **MSS** forms of
datums and datum-documents. A tool is a small read-shaped renderer: given a
selected datum context (sandbox + document + datum address) it produces a *panel
payload* the JS renderer paints into the workbench visualization panel.

> **Binding nuance (read this first).** Today a tool binds to datums by
> `applies_to_archetype` / `applies_to_source_kind` — widened along the datum's
> hyphae chain. It does **not** yet bind by a first-class *hyphae value* (e.g. a
> family's root common datum). This guide shows binding as it works today; see
> [Future: hyphae-value binding](#future-hyphae-value-binding) for the intended
> direction.

### The contract

Every tool is a Python object that satisfies the `WorkbenchTool` `Protocol`
defined in `MyCiteV2/packages/tools/_contract.py:20`. It is intentionally
minimal — a handful of identifying attributes and one method
(`_contract.py:30`):

```python
class WorkbenchTool(Protocol):
    tool_id: str
    label: str
    summary: str
    route: str
    applies_to_archetype: tuple[str, ...]
    applies_to_source_kind: tuple[str, ...]

    def build_panel_payload(
        self,
        *,
        authority_db_file: Path | None,
        sandbox_id: str,
        document_id: str,
        datum_address: str,
    ) -> dict[str, Any]:
        ...
```

- `tool_id` — the global key the tool is registered under and the value carried
  on `surface_query.tool`.
- `label` / `summary` — what the palette search renders for each item.
- `route` — the surface route the menu-bar palette stamps onto each item's
  `data-route` attribute; the JS `renderList` reads it and dispatches it on click
  (`_contract.py:33`).
- `applies_to_archetype` / `applies_to_source_kind` — the eligibility filters
  (see [step 3](#3-declare-what-the-tool-applies-to)).
- `build_panel_payload(...)` — returns the dict the JS renderer consumes. Keep
  it **read-shaped** (no mutations of the datum store).

The registry (`_registry.py`) is a plain dict keyed by `tool_id`. `register()`
(`_registry.py:22`) type-checks the object against the protocol and adds it;
`all_tools()` (`_registry.py:41`) returns every tool sorted by `tool_id`; and
`describe_for_palette()` (`_registry.py:46`) renders the registry as the palette
eligibility dicts.

## Step-by-step

### 1. Implement the `WorkbenchTool` contract

Create `MyCiteV2/packages/tools/<your_tool_id>.py` with a class that carries the
five attributes and `build_panel_payload`. Model it on
`MyCiteV2/packages/tools/workbench_ui_view.py:30`:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from pathlib import Path
from typing import Any

from MyCiteV2.packages.state_machine.portal_shell.shell_schemas import (
    WORKBENCH_UI_TOOL_ROUTE,
)

from ._registry import register


class MyTool:
    tool_id = "my_tool"
    label = "My Tool"
    summary = "Short, searchable description of what this tool views."
    route = WORKBENCH_UI_TOOL_ROUTE
    applies_to_archetype: tuple[str, ...] = ()
    applies_to_source_kind: tuple[str, ...] = ("sandbox_source",)

    def build_panel_payload(
        self,
        *,
        authority_db_file: Path | None,
        sandbox_id: str,
        document_id: str,
        datum_address: str,
    ) -> dict[str, Any]:
        # Read-only: compose the payload from the selected datum context.
        return {
            "schema": "mycite.v2.portal.workbench.tool.my_tool.v1",
            "sandbox_id": sandbox_id,
            "document_id": document_id,
            "selected_row_address": datum_address,
        }
```

Notes drawn from the real tools:

- `workbench_ui_view.py` is a thin palette entry whose `build_panel_payload`
  (`workbench_ui_view.py:47`) returns only a schema marker, because that tool
  *navigates to its own surface* rather than rendering in the panel — its heavy
  document/grid/overlay rendering lives in the read service
  `MyCiteV2/packages/tools/workbench_ui/service.py:468`
  (`WorkbenchUiReadService.read_surface`, `service.py:586`).
- `MyCiteV2/packages/tools/product_document_view.py:130`
  (`ProductDocumentViewer`) is the opposite pattern: its `build_panel_payload`
  (`product_document_view.py:144`) reads the sandbox's documents and resolves a
  full product table *inside* the payload. Use this pattern when your tool
  renders content directly into the panel.

If your tool needs more than trivial assembly, put the read logic in a sibling
service module (as `workbench_ui/` does) and keep the tool class as the
registry-facing shell.

### 2. Register it

Two things make the tool discoverable. First, self-register at module scope —
the last line of `workbench_ui_view.py:71` is the model:

```python
# Self-register on import.
register(MyTool())
```

Second, import your module from the package `__init__` so the registry is
populated whenever a consumer imports `MyCiteV2.packages.tools`. Add it to the
side-effect import block in `MyCiteV2/packages/tools/__init__.py` (alongside
`workbench_ui_view`, `product_document_view`, `cts_gis_*`):

```python
from . import (
    cts_gis_admin,        # noqa: F401
    cts_gis_district,     # noqa: F401
    cts_gis_map,          # noqa: F401
    my_tool,              # noqa: F401  <-- add this
    product_document_view,  # noqa: F401
    workbench_ui_view,    # noqa: F401
)
```

Import order is irrelevant: `all_tools()` sorts by `tool_id` on read.

### 3. Declare what the tool applies to

Eligibility is the OR of two intersections, computed against the selected
document's tokens:

- `applies_to_archetype` — matches the document's *archetype set*. That set is
  derived from `document_metadata` **and** widened by walking the datum's hyphae
  chain (`tool_eligibility.py:44`, `_document_archetype_set`). This is how a tool
  applicable to an upstream rudi's archetype is still offered for a downstream
  datum.
- `applies_to_source_kind` — matches the document's `source_kind` (e.g.
  `sandbox_source`, `system_anthology`).

Pick the narrowest binding that is correct:

- `workbench_ui` is the universal grid, so it binds by source kind to both
  `sandbox_source` and `system_anthology` (`workbench_ui_view.py:45`).
- `product_document` is specific to one archetype, so it binds *only* by
  `applies_to_archetype=("agro_erp_product_profile_row",)` and deliberately
  leaves `applies_to_source_kind` empty
  (`product_document_view.py:137`). The comment there explains why: because the
  match predicate ORs the two, declaring `sandbox_source` would make the viewer
  eligible for every sandbox document, not just product profiles.

An empty `applies_to_*` pair means "universal" in the palette runtime
(`portal_palette_runtime.py:75`) — the tool matches every datum. Use that
sparingly.

### 4. Add a `PortalToolRegistryEntry`

The viz registry above is what the *menu-bar search* consults. To also be a
first-class **palette target** (with a surface, capabilities, and read/write
posture), add a `PortalToolRegistryEntry` to the tuple returned by
`build_portal_tool_registry_entries()` in
`MyCiteV2/packages/state_machine/portal_shell/shell_registry.py:141`. Model it on
the `workbench_ui` entry (`shell_registry.py:165`):

```python
PortalToolRegistryEntry(
    tool_id="my_tool",
    label="My Tool",
    surface_id=MY_TOOL_SURFACE_ID,        # a known tool surface id
    entrypoint_id=MY_TOOL_ENTRYPOINT_ID,
    route=MY_TOOL_ROUTE,
    tool_kind=TOOL_KIND_GENERAL,
    surface_posture=SURFACE_POSTURE_PALETTE_TARGET,
    read_write_posture="read-only",
    required_capabilities=("datum_recognition",),
    default_enabled=True,
    default_workbench_visible=True,
    applies_to_source_kind=("sandbox_source",),
    summary="Short description of the tool.",
),
```

The dataclass is defined in
`MyCiteV2/packages/state_machine/portal_shell/shell.py:477`; its
`applies_to_archetype` / `applies_to_source_kind` fields are at
`shell.py:490`. Its `__post_init__` enforces the contract (`shell.py:502`):
`surface_posture` **must** be `SURFACE_POSTURE_PALETTE_TARGET`,
`read_write_posture` must be `read-only` or `write`, and a non-extension entry's
`surface_id` must be a known tool surface. For a dedicated surface you will also
add a `PortalSurfaceCatalogEntry` to `build_portal_surface_catalog()`
(`shell_registry.py:49`) and define the route/surface/entrypoint constants in
`shell_schemas.py` (the `WORKBENCH_UI_TOOL_*` constants are the template; the
route lives at `shell_schemas.py:84`).

> If your tool simply rides the universal workbench surface (like the two
> example tools, which both set `route = WORKBENCH_UI_TOOL_ROUTE`), you do not
> need a new surface — only the viz registration in steps 1–3. The
> `PortalToolRegistryEntry` is what gives a tool its own palette-target identity
> and posture.

### 5. Verify it appears in `/portal/api/tools/eligible`

The palette runtime `build_eligible_tools_response(...)`
(`portal_palette_runtime.py:80`) reads the viz registry via `all_tools()`,
filters with `_viz_tool_matches` (`portal_palette_runtime.py:59`), and returns
`{schema, tools: [{tool_id, label, summary, route}, ...]}`. The Flask endpoint is
`GET /portal/api/tools/eligible` at
`MyCiteV2/instances/_shared/portal_host/app.py:1707`.

Quick checks:

```python
# With no document context, every registered tool is returned (welcome screen).
from MyCiteV2.instances._shared.runtime.portal_palette_runtime import (
    build_eligible_tools_response,
)
out = build_eligible_tools_response(
    tenant_id="fnd", document_id="", datum_address="", datum_store=None
)
assert any(t["tool_id"] == "my_tool" for t in out["tools"])
```

```bash
# Live endpoint (no datum context returns all tools).
curl -s "http://localhost:PORT/portal/api/tools/eligible" | python -m json.tool
```

With a real document selected, the response narrows to the tools whose
`applies_to_*` match — so confirm your tool appears for a document of the
archetype / source_kind you bound to, and does **not** appear for others.

> The standalone pure recognizer used by the shell-side palette is
> `recognize_applicable_tools(...)` (`tool_eligibility.py:64`). It applies the
> same archetype/source_kind logic (plus the hyphae-chain widening) and is what
> the architecture/unit tests pin.

### 6. Confirm it mounts in the interface panel

The front-end is `v2_portal_tool_palette.js`. `mount(target, ctx)`
(`v2_portal_tool_palette.js:177`) renders a search input plus a results list and
calls `refresh`, which fetches the eligible tools and hands them to `renderList`
(`v2_portal_tool_palette.js:120`). `renderList` paints each tool's `label` and
`summary`, stamps the `route` onto the item's `data-route` attribute, and on
click invokes `ctx.onDispatch(...)` with `{tool_id, route, datum_address,
document_id, scope_depth}`.

So once your tool is returned by the endpoint, the palette will show it in the
search list automatically, and clicking it dispatches your `route`. Type part of
your `label`/`summary`/`tool_id` into the search box to confirm `filterTools`
matches it.

## Worked example: `workbench_ui` end-to-end

`workbench_ui` is the universal SQL-backed datum grid and the cleanest tool to
trace from registration to render:

1. **Contract object** —
   `MyCiteV2/packages/tools/workbench_ui_view.py:30` defines `WorkbenchUiTool`
   with `tool_id="workbench_ui"`, `route=WORKBENCH_UI_TOOL_ROUTE`, and
   `applies_to_source_kind=("sandbox_source", "system_anthology")`
   (`workbench_ui_view.py:45`).
2. **`build_panel_payload`** — returns just a schema marker
   (`workbench_ui_view.py:47`) because selecting it *navigates to its own
   surface* rather than painting into the panel.
3. **Self-register** — `register(WorkbenchUiTool())` at
   `workbench_ui_view.py:71`, and the module is imported from
   `MyCiteV2/packages/tools/__init__.py` so the registry is populated on import.
4. **Surface rendering** — the actual two-pane document table + datum grid +
   directive overlay is produced by `WorkbenchUiReadService`
   (`MyCiteV2/packages/tools/workbench_ui/service.py:468`); its `read_surface`
   (`service.py:586`) reads the authoritative catalog, projects rows, resolves
   lenses, and emits `interface_panel_sections` + a `surface_payload`. (Scope
   notes live in `MyCiteV2/packages/tools/workbench_ui/README.md`.)
5. **Palette target** — the matching `PortalToolRegistryEntry`
   (`shell_registry.py:165`) declares it `read-only`,
   `default_workbench_visible=True`, and `applies_to_source_kind=("sandbox_source",
   "system_anthology")`, mirroring the viz attributes so the eligibility logic
   agrees from both directions.
6. **Endpoint + palette** — `build_eligible_tools_response`
   (`portal_palette_runtime.py:80`) returns it whenever a `sandbox_source` or
   `system_anthology` document is selected (and always when no document is
   selected), and `v2_portal_tool_palette.js` renders and dispatches it.

For a tool that resolves and renders content *into* the panel rather than
navigating away, read `product_document_view.py:130` alongside this — same
contract, different `build_panel_payload` strategy.

## Pitfalls

- **Extensions are excluded from the palette.** A `PortalToolRegistryEntry` with
  `is_extension=True` (the `ext_*` entries in `shell_registry.py`) is skipped by
  `recognize_applicable_tools` (`tool_eligibility.py:102`). Extensions are
  Utilities surfaces, not palette tools — do not set `is_extension=True` for a
  workbench tool.
- **The eligibility recognizer must stay pure.** `tool_eligibility.py` is
  AST-scanned by `MyCiteV2/tests/architecture/test_palette_eligibility_purity.py`
  for forbidden imports (`os`, `sys`, `pathlib`, `sqlite3`, adapters, ports,
  instances, …) and for any top-level cache/handle/session state. Keep all
  eligibility logic data-driven off the registry entry's `applies_to_*` tuples;
  never add I/O there.
- **Keep `build_panel_payload` read-shaped.** Tools view and inspect; they do
  not mutate the datum store. `WorkbenchUiReadService` is explicit that it stays
  read-only and that mutation slots are emitted by the workbench runtime, not the
  tool (`workbench_ui/service.py:829`). Compose payloads from reads only.
- **Archetype OR source_kind, not AND.** Because the predicate ORs the two
  bindings, declaring a broad `source_kind` alongside a narrow archetype makes
  your tool eligible for far more documents than intended — see the explicit
  comment on `product_document_view.py:137`.
- **Two registries, kept in sync.** The viz registry (`_registry.py`) feeds the
  menu-bar search; the shell `PortalToolRegistryEntry` list (`shell_registry.py`)
  feeds palette-target identity. Their `applies_to_*` should agree, as
  `workbench_ui` keeps them (`workbench_ui_view.py:45` ↔ `shell_registry.py:178`).
- **Metadata key names matter.** The palette runtime reads
  `datum_template_archetype` and `samras_family` from `document_metadata`
  (`portal_palette_runtime.py:107`), while the pure recognizer reads the
  `archetype` key (`tool_eligibility.py:44`). When you wire test fixtures, use
  the key the path under test actually reads.

## Testing your tool

Add and run the tests that pin the contract for the surfaces you touched:

- **Eligibility logic** — `MyCiteV2/tests/unit/test_tool_eligibility.py`
  exercises `recognize_applicable_tools` (extensions excluded, archetype match,
  source_kind match, hyphae-chain widening, deterministic ordering, empty/unknown
  address). Add a case that asserts your `applies_to_*` binding matches the
  documents you expect and rejects the ones you don't.
- **Palette response + endpoint** — `MyCiteV2/tests/integration/test_tool_palette.py`
  drives `build_eligible_tools_response` and the `GET /portal/api/tools/eligible`
  endpoint, and asserts each tool entry carries `label`, `summary`, and the
  dispatch `route`. It already checks that `cts_gis` and `workbench_ui` appear in
  the no-context response; extend the assertions to include your `tool_id`.
- **Purity guard** — `MyCiteV2/tests/architecture/test_palette_eligibility_purity.py`
  is your safety net if you were tempted to add I/O to the recognizer. Run it to
  confirm you didn't.

Run them with the project's test runner (e.g.
`python -m pytest MyCiteV2/tests/unit/test_tool_eligibility.py
MyCiteV2/tests/integration/test_tool_palette.py
MyCiteV2/tests/architecture/test_palette_eligibility_purity.py`).

## Future: hyphae-value binding

Today a tool binds by **archetype / source_kind**, widened along the hyphae
chain — not by a first-class **hyphae value** (e.g. binding directly to a
family's *root common datum*). The `PortalToolRegistryEntry.manipulates_datum_kinds`
field (`shell.py:499`) is already reserved for future tool→datum applicability
checks but is not yet consumed by the eligibility predicate. When hyphae-value
binding lands, a tool will be able to declare the specific hyphae value (root
common datum of a family) it operates on, rather than approximating that
intent through archetype tokens.

For the canonical-datum and hyphae-flag model that this future binding will key
off, see [60 — Canonical datum and hyphae flags](60-canonical-datum-and-hyphae-flags.md)
(forward reference).
